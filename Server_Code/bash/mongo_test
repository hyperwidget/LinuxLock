#WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
#
# This scipt checks if number of collections in the database ( in our case linux_lock)
# is equal to the number specified by the user, and exits with error if not.
#
# Needed to check if mongo succesfully set up all the collections
# @author: Anatoly Spektor

#How to use it ?
# with mongo_setup: mongo < mongo_setup | ./mongo_test
# If you want to see all collections:
# with mongo_setup: mongo < mongo_setup | ./mongo_test -show


# Specify Number of existing collections (can be checked with " show collections " in mongo console)
# after running mongo_startup script
NUM_COLLECTIONS=11

# if you pipe this script to mongo_setup, we need to make sure mongo_scrip finished
sleep 2

# Actual Script
mongo  << ~ > output.json
use linux_lock
show collections
~
collection_num=$(cat output.json | tail -n +4 | head -n -1 | wc -l)
show_cols=$(cat output.json | tail -n +4 | head -n -1)

rm -r output.json > /dev/null
# use -show as an argument to show the collection list
if [[ $1 == '-show' ]]
 then
 echo "$show_cols"  
fi

if [ $collection_num -eq $NUM_COLLECTIONS ]
 then
   echo "--> All $collection_num were created succesfully"
   exit 0
else
   echo "Error: Collections required: $NUM_COLLECTIONS, Collections created: $collection_num"
   exit 312 #just for fun
 fi
